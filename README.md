# tvShowRecommendationSystem

**Description-**
These days, the small screen has some very big things to offer. From sitcoms to dramas to travel and talk shows, all the small screen shows are the best in showing diversity. TV shows are one of the biggest business markets out there. Also, it offers an opportunity to upcoming artists.

Over the years, the number of TV shows has increased exponentially and so has their customer base. A survey says that the top TV Shows can have 15-20 million viewers. With the advancement in technology and availability of cheap internet services, the reach of TV Shows is going to increase in the near future.

Our domain is Top TV Shows aired till date. We will use social networking APIs to get the data for entities which represent Companies, Genres, Subscriptions, Ratings, Producers, and Consumers for our domain.

**Working of Project-**
In this project we have achieved our goal to develop a system that recommends and answers queries related to TVShows and Movies. The tool which we have used is Jupyter Notebook for implementing python codes and SQLite3 Database. Before starting with the implementation of this project we designed thirty use cases that we would be covering in the project. We created the Entity Relationship diagram and Use case diagram to get the proper understanding of the project. On the basis of our use cases, we started gathering data by performing web scraping on various websites, like Twitter, IMDB. We also scanned through may data available on Kaggle. The next task we achieved was to perform the cleaning of data which we had gather through various platforms. While cleaning we had finalized our tables according to the use cases.After cleaning of data we started implementing the data normalization. We did this to avoid data redundancy and to achieve the data atomicity.Following this we had started writing Structured Query Language queries and Relational Algebra queries. After this we performed our use case queries and were able to achieve the desired results. Following this we had also used the matplotlib libraries to get the visualization of the queries. Visualisations helped in understanding the data more easily. Later, We created views and Stored procedures to reduce the time of writing the query repeatedly. Now our system is able to solve the user queries with the help of our database.
